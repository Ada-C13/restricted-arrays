# To find the correct value for index 1, a total of (n-2) comparisons are needed.
# To find the correct value for index 2, a total of (n-3) comparisons are needed.
# and so on ...
# To find the correct value for index (n-2), a total of 1 comparisons is needed.
# To find the correct value for the last index, a total of 0 comparisons are needed.
# Total number of comparisons = (n-1) + (n-2) + ... 3 + 2 + 1
#                             = (n * (n-1))/2
